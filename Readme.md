Welcome to Django Trading School â€“ an innovative platform for learning about trading and financial markets.

**Important Notice:**

1. This repository contains an early version of the Django Trading School project. It may not represent the latest features and improvements.

## Key Features

### User Management and Permissions

- **User Roles:** The project implements a comprehensive user role system with four levels of permissions: Superuser, Staff, Has_Right_Sign, Blocked, and Basic_User. Each role has distinct access and privileges tailored to their needs.

### Advanced Admin Panel with Jazzmin

- **Admin Enhancements:** The project utilizes the Jazzmin package to enhance the default Django admin panel. Jazzmin offers a modern and customizable interface for efficient administration of your application.

### Membership Plans and Course Access

- **Membership Plans:** Every user profile is associated with a membership plan, which determines their access to specific courses. This granular approach ensures that users only see courses relevant to their plan.

### Intelligent Scheduler for User Management

- **Auto-Blocking:** A scheduler is implemented to automatically block users who remain inactive for three consecutive months. This ensures the community remains engaged and active.

### Interactive Rating System

- **Lecture and Course Ratings:** Users can provide ratings and reviews for both individual lectures and entire courses. This interactive rating system helps users make informed decisions about which content to engage with.

### Ranking System and User Activation

- **User Activation:** A ranking system encourages user engagement by rewarding active participation. Users can climb the ranks based on their contributions and interactions on the platform.
